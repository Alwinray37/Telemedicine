      <h2>The main symptoms of BV (Bacterial Vaginosis) are a thin gray, white, or green vaginal discharge that smells like fish.  The smell may be more noticeable during or after vaginal intercourse. There  may also be a vaginal itching and a burning that occurs during urination.<br>

      <td colspan="5"><h1>WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF (BV) BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS?</h1>
      <h2>The exact cause of BV (Bacterial Vaginosis) is complex. BV occurs because of the both the undergrowth of normal vaginal bacteria and overgrowth of normal vaginal bacteria; and there are many different normal vaginal bacteria.  BV usually occurs when the complex balance of these bacteria becomes unbalanced.  There are at least three types of bacteria that are usually involved.  Lactobacillus bacteria usually decreases in number, while Gardnerella bacteria and group B streptococcus bacteria usually increase.  This imbalance of the normal vaginal bacteria causes the symptoms of Bacterial Vaginosis.<br>

      <td colspan="5"><h1>HOW IS BV (BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS) DIAGNOSED?</h1>
      <h2>Ideally bacterial vaginosis will be diagnosed by taking a careful history, by physical exam of the vagina, and by examining a small drop of the vaginal discharge under a microscope.  However, there is a relatively new product that is quicker and less invasive, called VS-SENSE™.  This product only requires a vaginal swab of the discharge to be tested.  It can be done in a few minutes, is about 90% accurate, and does not require a pelvic exam.  But, this product is only available in clinics, doctor offices, and hospitals.<br>
