        WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF C-DIFF. (CLOSTRIDIODES DIFFICILE)?</h1>
        <h2>The symptoms of  C. Diff are diarrhea with or without mucous. The diarrhea typically begins 5 to 10 days after starting antibiotics—but may occur on the first day or up to 2 months later. Diarrhea may vary from  mild to severe.  Stool may be semiformed, watery, or sometimes bloody. Abdominal cramping or pain is common, but nausea and vomiting are rare. The abdomen may be slightly tender.</h2>
      <h2>In the worst cases, patients may have abdominal pain and appear very ill. They may also have a fast pulse rate (more than 100 per minute) and abdominal distention and tenderness.      <br>

      <td colspan="5"><h1>WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF C. DIFF. (CLOSTRIDIODES DIFFICILE)?</h1>
        <h2>C. Diff, Clostridioides D. (formerly Clostridium Difficile) is the bacteria that cause a C. Diff. Infection.  This bacteria can a part a person’s normal intestinal flora or can be transmitted to one person to another.</h2>
      <h2>Typically, C. Diff. occurs when a person is given intravenous antibiotics.  But, it can occur spontaneously without taking antibiotics.<br>

      <td colspan="5"><h1>HOW IS C. DIFF. DIAGNOSED?</h1>
      <h2>C. Diff. can be diagnosed by a careful history and test of the stool.  The test of stool is usually composed of two parts.  One part is to look at a small smear of the stool under a microscope.  The second part is to test the stool for two different toxins, called Toxin A and Toxin B.<br>

      <td colspan="5"><h1>WHAT ARE THE TREATMENTS FOR C. DIFF.?</h1>
        <h2>1. Oral Antibiotics:<br>
          <br>
          A. Oral Vancomycin: usually 125 mg 4 x /day for 10 days. (Sometimes longer)<br>
          <br>
          B. Fidaxomicin (Dificid) 200mg tablet 2 x /day for 10 days<br>
          <br>
        C. Rifaximin is sometimes prescribed after a course of Vancomycin if a person does not respond well to Vancomycin alone.</h2>
        <h2><br>
          <br>
          2. Antidiarrheal agents:<br>
          <br>
          A. Bismuth Subsalicylate (BSS) (Pepto Bismol) - has antibacterial properties against C. Diff. ; therefore, might be of some benefit in treating C. Diff.<br>
          <br>
          B. Imodium and Lomotil are not recommended to treat C. Diff. because they have no anti C. Diff. qualities and may indirectly increase the toxin that are effected the large intestine. </h2>
        <h2><br>
          <br>
          3. Intravenous Medication:<br>
          <br>
      A. Bezlotoxumab is a monoclonal antibody that is given by vein. It binds to one of the toxins produced by Clostridium difficile. The combination of Bezlotoxumab and Vancomycin or Dificid is usually more effected than just Vancomycin or Dificid alone.</h2></td>

      <td colspan="5"><h4>1. Drugs such as Imodium and Lomotil that decrease diarrhea might be detrimental in the treatment of diarrhea caused by C. Diff.  This is because C. Diff. bacteria makes a toxin, and if diarrhea is slowed down, this may leave the C. Diff Toxin in contact with a patient’s colon for a longer period of time.<br>
        <br>
        2. In about 15 to 20% of people with a C. Diff. infection, C. Diff. returns.  They may require a repeat dose of either Dificid or Vancomycin— or they may need a prolonged course of Vancomycin.<br>
        <br>
        3. All medication, including antibiotics that treat C. Diff, have a risk of side effects.</h4>
        <h4> 4. Possible Mild side effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, itching, and light to moderate skin rash.<br>
      </h4>
        <h4>5. Possible Severe side effects are a severe skin rash, an anaphylactic allergic reaction (leading to the inability to breathe and subsequent death if not treated rapidly), and Clostridioides difficile infection (C. Diff.) of the colon.<br>
        </h4>
      <h4>6.  Medications such as creams, lotions, and gels should be tested in small dosages in areas of the body that are not easily seen.</h4></td>
