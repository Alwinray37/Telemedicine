      <td colspan="5"><h1>WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF GOUT OR PSEUDO GOUT?</h1>
        <h2>Gout: The primary cause of gout is that the body either produces an excessive amount of uric acid—or the body does not excrete a sufficient amount of uric acid in the urine.  Either way the end results is that there is an increased amount of uric acid in blood.  This excess or uric acid in the blood then causes uric acid to move outside the blood into a joint space and form uric acid crystals.  These uric acid crystals in the joint cause the joint to become inflamed, swollen, and painful.</h2>
        <h2><br>
          Pseudo gout: The cause is similar to gout—except the crystals are from calcium pyrophosphate deposition—not from uric acid crystals.

        <h2>Gout can be diagnosed by a careful history.  The diagnosis can be proven by removing fluid from a joint with a needle and syringe and finding crystals in the fluid with a microscope. Sometimes an X-ray or an ultrasound of a part of the body can show a uric acid crystal; however, this can not be done for all part of the body.</h2>
        <h2>Pseudo gout can also be diagnosed by a careful history.  The diagnosis can also be proven by the examination of the fluid from a joint.</h2>
        <h2>Some blood test might be needed to determine if the joint inflammation is due to rheumatoid arthritis vs gout or pseudo gout.<br>

        1. The treatment is the same for gout as pseudo gout; however, the prevention of gout and pseudo gout are different.  The medication to treat both gout and pseudo gout are Prednisone, Colchicine, and NSAIDS.  There is no clear cut benefit of one medications over the other.</h2>
        <h2>2. Prednisone or Prednisolone (if there is NO indication of infection)</h2>
        <h2>3. Colchicine —OR——NSAIDS (Indomethacin, Naproxen); Colchicine is best when the medication are started early in gout flare up.  Colchicine can be combined with NSAIDS-but they are both doing the same thing, reducing inflammation, so this is not usually recommended.</h2>
        <h2>* Medications that lower uric acid in the blood should be continued if a person is already taking, but not started during a gout flare up.  These medications are the following: allopurinol, febuxostat, probenecid, lesinurad, benzbromarone, or pegloticase.<br>
