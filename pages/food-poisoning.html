      <td colspan="5"><h1>WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF FOOD POISONING?</h1>
        <h2>Food poisoning is usually caused by a bacteria or a virus.  The most common bacteria are the following: Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter, Listeria Monocytogenes, Vibrio Parahaemolyticus, Bacillus Cereus, and Entero-pathogenic Escherichia Coli. These bacteria usually come from raw food.</h2>
        <h2>The onset or length of time between eating a food with a bacteria and the beginning of the symptoms gives a clue as to what bacteria or virus may be causing the illness.</h2>
        <h2>1 to 6 hours: Staphylococcus aureus.  This bacteria can be spread by meats, prepared salads, cream sauces, and cream-filled pastries. In addition, it can be spread by hand contact.</h2>
        <h2>8 to 16 hours: Clostridium Perfringens.  This bacteria is usually in <br>
          meats, stews, and gravies. The bacteria are usually spread by  serving dishes don't keep food hot enough, or when food is not refrigerated soon enough.</h2>
        <h2>9 to 48 hours: Listeria.  This bacteria is usually spread by <br>
          undercooked hot dogs, luncheon meats, unpasteurized milk and cheeses, and unwashed raw produce. It can also be spread through contaminated soil and water.</h2>
        <h2>12 to 48 hours: Noroviruses (Norwalk-like viruses).  This virus is usually spread through raw, ready-to-eat produce and shellfish, and from contaminated water. It can also be spread by an infected food handler.</h2>
        <h2>12 to 72 hours: Clostridium Botulinum.  This bacteria is usually in<br>
          home-canned foods, smoked or salted fish, potatoes baked in aluminum foil, and other foods kept at warm temperatures for too long.</h2>
        <h2>24 to 48 hours: Shigella.  This bacteria is usually spread through<br>
          seafood and raw, ready-to-eat produce. In addition, it can be spread by an infected food handler.</h2>
        <h2>1 o 3 days: Salmonella.  This bacteria is usually spread through<br>
          raw or contaminated meat, poultry, milk, or egg yolks. It can live eve when food are cooked—if the food is insufficiently cooked.  It can also be spread by knives and cutting surfaces.  In addition, it can be spread by infected food handler.</h2>
        <h2>1 to 3 days: Rotavirus.  This virus is usually spread through raw, ready-to-eat produce. It can also be spread by an infected food handler.</h2>
        <h2>Vibrio vulnificus: 1 to 7 days.  This bacteria is usually spread by <br>
          raw oysters and raw or undercooked mussels, clams, and whole scallops. It can also be spread through contaminated seawater.</h2>
        <h2>1 to 8 Days: Escherichia Coli (E. Coli).  This bacteria is usually in <br>
          beef which was contaminated with feces during the slaughtering process.  In addition, this beef is then usually undercooked. Other sources E. Coli. include unpasteurized milk, apple cider, alfalfa sprouts, and contaminated water.</h2>
        <h2>2 to 5 days: Campylobacter.  This bacteria is usually in meat, poultry, unpasteurized milk, or contaminated water.</h2>
        <h2>1 to 2 weeks: Giardia Lamblia.  This bacteria is usually found in <br>
          raw, ready-to-eat produce, and contaminated water.  It can also be spread by an infected food handler.</h2>
        <h2>28 Days: Hepatitis A.  This bacteria is spread from<br>
          raw, ready-to-eat produce and shellfish, and  from contaminated water.  It Can be also spread by an infected food handler.        <br>
