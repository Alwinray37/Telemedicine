                    Patients with CDI in the setting of another underlying infection requiring prolonged duration of antibiotic therapy are at increased risk for recurrent CDI [7]. <br />
                    <span style="color: #FF0000">In such cases, we typically continue CDI treatment throughout the antibiotic course plus an additional tail of one week after its completion </span>[21,22].

                    <br />
                    <strong>Corticosteroids</strong> are usually used topically but may be injected into small or recalcitrant lesions. (CAUTION: <em>Systemic corticosteroids may precipitate exacerbations or development of pustular psoriasis and should not be used to treat psoriasis</em>.) Topical corticosteroids are used twice daily. Corticosteroids are most effective when used overnight under occlusive polyethylene coverings or incorporated into tape; a corticosteroid cream is applied without occlusion during the day. <a href="https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/dermatologic-disorders/principles-of-topical-dermatologic-therapy/principles-of-topical-dermatologic-therapy#v959637" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Anti-inflammatory agents" data-id="0dca05f0-8802-4311-b086-d0617b6e10f5" data-itemid="2194e3e1-c5f5-4d78-83c8-593a52995931">Corticosteroid potency</a> is selected according to the extent of involvement.<br />
                    <br />
                     Ideally, after about 3 weeks, an emollient, vitamin D3 analog, or calcineurin inhibitor should be substituted for the corticosteroid for 1 to 2 weeks (as a rest period); <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Vitamin D3 analogs</strong> <br />
                    1.
                    calcipotriol [calcipotriene] 0.0005% $80/60G, <br />
                    2. 
                    calcitriol) $350/tube <br />
                    are topical vitamin D analogs that induce normal keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation; they can be used alone or in combination with topical corticosteroids. Some clinicians have patients apply calcipotriol on weekdays and corticosteroids on weekends.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Calcineurin inhibitors</strong> <br />
                    (eg, tacrolimus, <br />
                    pimecrolimus) <br />
                    are available in topical form and are generally well-tolerated. They are not as effective as corticosteroids but may avoid the complications of corticosteroids when treating facial and intertriginous psoriasis. It is not clear whether they increase the risk of lymphoma and skin cancer.<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Tazarotene</strong> is a topical retinoid. It is less effective than corticosteroids as monotherapy but is a useful adjunct.<br />
                    <br />
                  <strong>Emollients</strong> include emollient creams, ointments, petrolatum, paraffin, and even hydrogenated vegetable (cooking) oils. They reduce scaling and are most effective when applied twice daily and immediately after bathing. Lesions may appear redder as scaling decreases or becomes more transparent. Emollients are safe and should probably always be used for mild to moderate plaque psoriasis.<br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>Salicylic acid</strong> is a keratolytic that softens scales, facilitates their removal, and increases absorption of other topical agents. It is especially useful as a component of scalp treatments; scalp scale can be quite thick.                  </h2>
                  <h2 data-originaltitle="Treatment"><strong>??? Selsun Blue: Coal tar</strong> preparations are anti-inflammatory and decrease keratinocyte hyperproliferation via an unknown mechanism. Ointments or solutions are typically applied at night and washed off in the morning. Coal tar products can be used in combination with topical corticosteroids or with exposure to natural or artificial broad-band UVB light (280 to 320 nm) in slowly increasing increments (Goeckerman regimen). Shampoos should be left in for 5 to 10 minutes and then rinsed out. <br />
                    <br />
                  <strong>Anthralin</strong> is a topical antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory agent. Its mechanism of action is unknown. Effective dose is 0.1% cream or ointment increased to 1% as tolerated. Anthralin may be irritating and should be used with caution in intertriginous areas; it also stains. Irritation and staining can be avoided by washing off the anthralin 20 to 30 minutes after application. Using a liposome-encapsulated preparation may also avoid some disadvantages of anthralin.                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Phototherapy                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <strong>UV light therapy</strong> is typically used in patients with extensive psoriasis. The mechanism of action is unknown, although UVB light reduces DNA synthesis and can induce mild systemic immunosuppression. In psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA), oral methoxypsoralen, a photosensitizer, is followed by exposure to long-wave UVA light (330 to 360 nm). PUVA has an antiproliferative effect and also helps to normalize keratinocyte differentiation. Doses of light are started low and increased as tolerated. Severe burns can result if the dose of drug or UVA is too high.                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Excimer laser therapy is a type of phototherapy using a 308-nm laser directed at focal psoriatic plaques.</h2>
                  <p>Immunosuppressants</p>
                  <p><strong>Methotrexate</strong> taken orally is an effective treatment for severe disabling psoriasis, especially severe psoriatic arthritis or widespread erythrodermic or pustular psoriasis unresponsive to topical agents or UV light therapy (narrowband UVB) or PUVA. Methotrexate seems to interfere with the rapid proliferation of epidermal cells. Hematologic, renal, and hepatic function should be monitored. </p>

                  <p>                  can be used for severe psoriasis. It should be limited to courses of several months (rarely, up to 1 year) and alternated with other therapies. <span style="color: #ff0000">Its effect on the kidneys and potential long-term effects on the immune system preclude more liberal use. </span></p>

                  <p>Choice of therapy</p>
                  <p> First-line treatment for psoriasis includes topical corticosteroids and topical vitamin D3 analogs (either as monotherapy or in combination).</p>
                  <p>Rotational therapy refers to the substitution of one therapy for another after 1 to 2 years to reduce the adverse effects caused by chronic use and to circumvent disease resistance. </p>
                  <p><strong>Mild plaque psoriasis</strong> can be treated with emollients, keratolytics, tar, topical corticosteroids, vitamin D3 analogs, or anthralinalone or in combination. Moderate exposure to sunlight is beneficial, but sunburn can induce exacerbations.</p>
                  <p><strong>Moderate to severe plaque psoriasis</strong> should be treated with topical agents and either phototherapy or systemic agents. Immunosuppressants are used for quick, short-term control</p>
                  <p><strong>Scalp plaques</strong> are notoriously difficult to treat because they resist systemic therapy, and because hair blocks application of topical agents and scale removal and shields skin from UV light. </p>
                  <p>A suspension of 10% salicylic acid in mineral oil may be rubbed into the scalp at bedtime manually or with a toothbrush, covered with a shower cap (to enhance penetration and avoid messiness), and washed out the next morning with a tar (or other) shampoo. </p>
                  <p>More cosmetically acceptable corticosteroid solutions can be applied to the scalp during the day. These treatments are continued until the desired clinical response is achieved.</p>
                  <p>Cortisone Injections<br />
                    Resistant skin or scalp patches may respond to local superficial intralesional injection of triamcinolone acetonide suspension diluted with saline to 2.5 or 5 mg/mL, depending on the size and severity of the lesion. Injections may cause local atrophy, which is usually reversible.<br />

                    <p>Primary treatment is topical or oral scabicides (see table <a href="https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/dermatologic-disorders/parasitic-skin-infections/scabies#v60579839" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Treatment Options for Scabies" data-id="851cfc52-6529-4ae6-b782-c7fe1de62689" data-itemid="27381683-5f53-4f4b-913c-049eeca41dd9">Treatment Options for Scabies</a>). Permethrin is the first-line topical drug.</p>
                  </div>
<div>
                    <p>Older children and adults should apply permethrin or lindane to the entire body from the neck down and wash it off after 8 to 14 hours. Permethrin is often preferred because lindane can be neurotoxic. Treatments should be repeated in 7 days.</p>
                  </div>
<div>
                    <p>For infants and young children, permethrin should be applied to the head and neck, avoiding periorbital and perioral regions. Special attention should be given to intertriginous areas, fingernails, toenails, and the umbilicus. Mittens on infants can keep permethrin out of the mouth. Lindane is not recommended in children &lt; 2 years of age or in patients with a seizure disorder because of potential neurotoxicity.</p>

<div>
                    <p>For adults and children 4 years of age and older, spinosad 0.9% topical suspension should be applied to the entire cutaneous surface from the neck down, including the soles and feet. In bald patients, the suspension should be applied to the scalp, forehead, hairline, and temples. The suspension should be allowed to dry for 10 minutes before getting dressed and then left on the skin for 6 hours before showering or bathing. Treatment should be repeated in 1 week ( <a href="https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/dermatologic-disorders/parasitic-skin-infections/scabies#v60579932" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Treatment reference" data-id="1967fb73-cbbe-4194-92cd-804b49ab68b4" data-itemid="27381683-5f53-4f4b-913c-049eeca41dd9">1</a>).</p>

                    Treatment of seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp should include shampooing at least twice a week, because less frequent shampooing enables proliferation of <em>Malassezia</em>. Antifungal shampoos (eg, ketoconazole 2% or 1%) are highly effective in controlling the dandruff of seborrheic dermatitis. Keratolytic shampoos (zinc pyrithione, selenium sulfide, or sulfur and salicylic acid) and tar shampoos (available over the counter in the US) used daily or every other day until dandruff is controlled and twice/week thereafter are also helpful. If antifungals and keratolytics fail to sufficiently relieve pruritus, topical corticosteroid solutions (eg, 0.01% fluocinolone acetonide solution) are used.<br />
                    <br />
                    and lower potency corticosteroid solutions (eg, 0.025% triamcinolone) should be used when possible.<br />
                    <br />
                    For milder cases, 2% ketoconazole cream or other topical imidazoles applied twice daily are often sufficient. If not, mild topical corticosteroids (1 to 2.5% hydrocortisone cream, 0.2% hydrocortisone valerate cream) are applied twice daily.<br />
                    <br />
                    Calcineurin inhibitors (pimecrolimus and tacrolimus) are also effective, particularly when long-term use is necessary and antifungals alone are not sufficiently effectiv<br />
                  </p>
                  <p>In infants, a baby shampoo is used daily, and 1 to 2.5% hydrocortisone cream or fluocinolone 0.01% oil can be used once to twice daily for redness and scaling on the scalp or face. Topical antifungals such as ketoconazole 2% cream or econazole 1% cream can also be helpful in severe cases.                    <br />

                    Treatment may need RENAL DOSING
<br />
                    <br />
Treatment of herpes zoster should start as soon as possible, ideally during the prodrome, and is less likely to be effective if given &gt; 72 hours after skin lesions appear, especially in the absence of newly forming lesions. Famciclovir 500 mg 3 times a day for 7 days and valacyclovir 1 g 3 times a day for 7 days have better bioavailability with oral dosing than acyclovir, and therefore for herpes zoster, they are generally preferred to oral acyclovir 800 mg 5 times a day for 7 to 10 days. Corticosteroids do not decrease the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia.<br />
<br />
For less severely immunocompromised patients, oral famciclovir, valacyclovir, or acyclovir (see above) is a reasonable option; famciclovir and valacyclovir are preferred. For severely immunocompromised patients, acyclovir is recommended at a dosage of 10 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 7 to 10 days for adults and 20 mg/kg IV every 8 hours for 7 days for children &lt; 12 years. Some experts recommend treatment beyond 7 to 10 days, lasting until all lesions are crusted, for immunocompromised patients.<br />
<br />
Although data concerning the safety of acyclovir and valacyclovir during pregnancy are reassuring, the safety of antiviral therapy during pregnancy is not firmly established.<br />

                  </span>Hidradenitis suppurativa<br />
                  Hidradenitis suppurativa is currently thought to be a chronic inflammatory condition of the hair follicle and associated structures. Follicular inflammation and subsequent occlusion leads to rupture of the follicle and development of abscesses, sinus tracts, and scarring. <br />
                  Swollen, tender masses resembling cutaneous abscesses develop. <br />
                  <br />
                  These lesions are often sterile. Pain, fluctuance, discharge, and sinus tract formation are characteristic in chronic cases. In chronic cases, bacterial infection may occur in deep abscesses and sinus tracts. In chronic axillary cases, coalescence of inflamed nodules causes palpable cordlike fibrotic bands. The condition may become disabling because of pain and foul odor. <br />
                  <br />
Stage I: Abscess formation, single or multiple, without sinus tracts or scarring<br />
<br />
Stage II: Single or multiple, widely separated, recurrent abscesses with sinus tract formation or scarring<br />
<br />
Stage III: Diffuse or near diffuse involvement or multiple interconnected sinus tracts and abscesses across the entire area<br />
<br />
For <strong>Hurley stage I disease,</strong> typical treatment <br />
All may be used at the same time:
<br />
<span style="color: #00008b">1. 
1% clindamycin topical </span>solution 2 times a day, topical <br />
2.<span style="color: #00008b"> resorcinol</span> 15% cream once a day, <br />
3.
OTC:for Zinc deficiency: oral <span style="color: #00008b">zinc gluconate</span> (90 mg once a day), <br />
4. intralesional corticosteroids (eg, 0.1 to 0.5 mL of a 5 to 10 mg/mL solution of triamcinolone acetonide once a month), and <br />
5. short (eg, <span style="color: #00098b">7- to 10-day)</span> courses of oral antibiotics. <br />
A. 
Tetracycline (500 mg 2 times a day), <br />
B. 
<span style="color: #00008b">doxycycline</span> (100 to 200 mg once a day), <br />
C. 
minocycline (100 mg once a day), or <br />
D. erythromycin (250 to 500 mg 4 times a day) are used until the lesions resolve. <br />
5.
The skin is washed with benzoyl peroxide.<br />
<br />
For <strong>Hurley stage II disease,</strong> <span style="color: #00008b">treatment is with a longer (eg, 2- to 3-month)</span> course of the <br />
1.
same oral antibiotics used to treat stage I disease; <br />
2. 
if response is incomplete, add: clindamycin 300 mg orally 2 times a day and<br />
or <br />
<span style="color: #00008b">rifampin 600 mg $40/month {poss: liver tox} </span>orally once a day may be added to the regimen. <br />
3.
Adding antiandrogen therapy (eg, with <span style="color: #00008b">oral estrogen or combination oral </span>contraceptives, spironolactone, cyproterone acetate [not available in the US], finasteride, or combinations) may be helpful in women. <br />
4.<span style="color: #ff0000"> Incision and drainage may reduce the pain but will not cure--like in abscess</span><br />
5. 
For acute inflammatory lesions that are not excessively deep, punch debridement (ie, excision with a 5- to 7-mm punch instrument followed by digital debridement and curettage or scrubbing) is preferable. <br />
6. Sinus tracts should be unroofed and debrided. <br />
<br />
For <strong>Hurley Stage III disease,</strong> medical and surgical therapy should be more aggressive.<br />
1.
infliximab (5 mg/kg IV at weeks 0, 2, and 6). Alternatively, <br />
2. 
adalimumab may be given <br />
3.
Oral retinoids (isotretinoin - accutane <br />
4. 
Wide surgical excision and repair or grafting of the affected areas is often necessary if the disease persists. <br />
5. 
Ablative laser therapy (CO2 or erbium:YAG) is an alternate surgical treatment. Laser hair removal has also been used with some success.<br />

2. frequent washing of bed sheets, pillowcases, and blankets in hot water. <br />
3. Ideally, upholstered furniture, soft toys, carpets, curtains, and pets should be removed, at least from the bedroom, to reduce dust mites and animal dander.<br />
4. Dehumidifiers should be used in basements and in other poorly aerated, damp rooms to reduce mold. <br />
5. Steam treatment of homes diminishes dust mite allergens. <br />
5. House cleaning and extermination to eliminate cockroach exposure are especially important. <br />
6. Sulfite-sensitive patients should avoid sulfite-containing food (eg, certain wine and salad dressings). <br />
7. Nonallergenic triggers, such as cigarette smoke, strong odors, irritant fumes, cold temperatures, and high humidity should also be avoided <br />

                    Anticholinergics (antimuscarinics) relax bronchial smooth muscle through competitive inhibition of muscarinic receptors (M1, M2, and M3). <br />

Stage 4: <u>Add Steroids</u> to LABA &amp; LAMA<br />
Inhaled corticosteroids <span style="color: #333; font-size: 18px;">Corticosteroids are often part of treatment. Inhaled corticosteroids seem to reduce airway inflammation, reverse beta-receptor down-regulation, and inhibit leukotriene and cytokine production. They do not alter the course of pulmonary function decline in patients with COPD who continue to smoke, but they do relieve symptoms and improve short-term pulmonary function in some patients, are additive to the effect of bronchodilators, and diminish the frequency of COPD exacerbations. </span><span style="font-size: 18px; color: #333;">They are indicated for patients who have repeated exacerbations or symptoms despite optimal bronchodilator therapy. Inhaled corticosteroids are of greatest benefit in patients who have <a href="https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/hematology-and-oncology/eosinophilic-disorders/eosinophilia" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Eosinophilia" data-id="eb02b05a-0a00-45ed-bb40-659695a1fae6" data-itemid="6ff89cbd-5a3b-4997-86c5-bf60fbb5735f">eosinophilia</a>. Dose depends on the drug; examples include fluticasone 500 to 1000 mcg/day and beclomethasone 400 to 2000 mcg/day.<br />

Inhaled corticosteroi--&gt;are more effective than either drug alone in the treatment of chronic UNSTABLE stable disease.{Tom: but put patients at a greater risk of pneumonia}<br />
Oral or systemic corticosteroids should usually not be used to treat chronic stable COPD. {maybe with an acute accerbatoin???}<br />
Theophylline: Rarely used these days: Only considered in Recalcitrant cases: must monitor blood levels- toxicity is possible<br />
Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors<br />
                                    are more specific than theophylline for pulmonary phosphodiesterase and have fewer adverse effects. They have anti-inflammatory properties and are mild bronchodilators. Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors such as <u>roflumilastcan</u> be used in addition to other bronchodilators for reduction of exacerbations in patients who have COPD with chronic bronchitis. Roflumilast should be started at a oral dose of 250 mcg once a day and increased to 500 mcg once a day as tolerated.</p>

                    <br />
                  If you have type 2 diabetes, your body makes insulin but no longer uses it well.</p>
                  <p>Your body can&rsquo;t make enough insulin to keep your <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/15-ways-to-lower-blood-sugar">blood sugar levels</a> normal. The goal of treatment for you is to help your body use your insulin better or to get rid of extra sugar in your blood.</p>
                  <p>Most medications for type 2 diabetes are oral drugs. However, a few come as injections. Some people with type 2 diabetes may also need to take insulin.</p>
                  <h3>Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors</h3>
                  <p>These medications help your body break down starchy foods and table sugar. This effect lowers your blood sugar levels.</p>
                  <p>For the best results, you should take these drugs before meals. These drugs include: <span style="color: #006400">They do not cause hypoglycemia</span><br />

                  <h3>Biguanides</h3>
                  <p>Biguanides decrease how much sugar your <a href="https://www.healthline.com/human-body-maps/liver">liver</a> makes. They decrease how much sugar your intestines absorb, make your body more sensitive to insulin, and help your muscles absorb glucose.</p>
                  <p>The most common biguanide is <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/metformin-oral-tablet">metformin</a> (trade names: Glucophage, Metformin Hydrochloride ER, Glumetza, Riomet, Fortamet).</p>

                  <h3>Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 receptor agonists)</h3>
                  <p>These drugs are similar to the natural hormone called incretin.</p>
                  <p>They increase B-cell growth and how much insulin your body uses. They decrease your appetite and how much glucagon your body uses. They also slow stomach emptying.</p>
                  <p>These are all important actions for people with diabetes.</p>
                  <p>For some people, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease may predominate over their diabetes.

                  Lomitapide is an inhibitor of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein that interferes with the secretion of TG-rich lipoproteins in the liver and intestine. Dose is begun low and gradually titrated up about every 2 weeks. Patients must follow a diet with less than 20% of calories from fat. Lomitapide can cause gastrointestinal adverse effects (eg, diarrhea, increased hepatic fat, elevated liver enzymes). Evinacumab is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits angiopoietin-like protein 3, an inhibitor of LPL and endothelial lipase. It can decrease LDL cholesterol (by 47%), TG, and HDL cholesterol. Evinacumab is given by intravenous infusion once monthly. It can cause gout, influenza-like illness, and infusion reactions. </p>
                <p><strong>Drastic Approach: Procedural approaches</strong> are reserved for patients with severe hyperlipidemia (LDL cholesterol &gt; 300 mg/dL [&gt; 7.74 mmol/L]) and no vascular disease. <span style="color: #006400">LDL apheresis may be done in patients with LDL cholesterol &gt; 200 mg/dL (&gt; 5.16 mmol/L) and vascular disease that is refractory to conventional therapy</span>, such as occurs with familial hypercholesterolemia. Options include LDL apheresis (in which LDL is removed by extracorporeal plasma exchange) and, rarely, ileal bypass (to block reabsorption of bile acids) and liver transplantation (which transplants LDL receptors). LDL apheresis is the procedure of choice in most instances when maximally tolerated therapy fails to lower LDL adequately. Apheresis is also the usual therapy in patients with the homozygous form of familial hypercholesterolemia who have limited or no response to drug therapy.<br />

                  1. first implement lifestyle changes: including exercise, weight loss, and avoidance of concentrated dietary sugar and alcohol.  <br />

                  <br />
                  If the patient does not show a robust response, we increase the SRI in one-week increments until sufficient improvement is seen or the maximum recommended or highest tolerated dose is reached. <br />
                  <br />
                  In individuals who show gradual improvement, we continue to monitor for up to 12 weeks at the maximum tolerated dose.<br />
                  <span style="color: #ff8b00">Example</span><br />
                  As an example, treatment with sertraline can be initiated at 25 mg per day. <br />
                  After a week, sertraline can be increased to a therapeutic dose of 50 mg/day to 100 mg/day and continued for a total of four to six weeks. <br />
                  If the patient does not experience a robust clinical response, sertraline can be titrated up in increments of 50 mg every one to two weeks <br />
                  to a maximum of 200 mg/day. </p>
                <p>(See &quot;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;, section on 'Dose'.)<br />
                  Common side effects include sexual dysfunction, gastrointestinal abnormalities (nausea and diarrhea), insomnia, sedation, weight gain, dizziness, and sweating. <br />
                  <br />
                  In individuals treated with venlafaxine, increases in blood pressure can be seen. <br />
                  <br />
                  In these cases, blood pressure should be monitored weekly (table 2). </p>
                <p>Adjunctive therapy for early side effects — <br />
                  Early adverse effects of SRI treatment include agitation and insomnia which can often lead to discontinuation of the medication before it has had time to effectively treat the primary anxiety associated with GAD. Our approach to addressing early SRI-induced insomnia or agitation is as follows:<br />
                  ●<br />
                  Individuals without a history of substance use or disorder – In individuals without a history of substance use or substance use disorder, a benzodiazepine (eg, lorazepam 1 to 2 mg/day in divided doses) can be added. </p>
                <p>{other meds} hydroxyzine “Atarax” (an antihistamine with efficacy for insomnia in GAD [43]) or gabapentin “Neurontin”. We typically continue the medication for four to six weeks and then taper off if irritability and insomnia are improved.</p>
                <p><br />
                  <span style="color: #ff8b00"><strong>Adjunctive CBT</strong></span> — <br />
                   1. cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).<br />
                   2. buspirone.                   initial dose is 10 mg/day; this can be 3. increased by 10 mg every one to two weeks to a maximum dose of 60 mg/day <br />
                   4. gabapentin: In individuals who do not respond to buspirone, we use<br />
                   5. Pregabalin is another option; however, due to the greater potential of addiction and dependence to pregabalin, we typically use gabapentin.<br />
                   6. Lamotrigine or Valporate: In individuals who have not fully responded to initial treatment and in whom there are clinically significant mood fluctuations (eg, hypomania or irritability), we occasionally augment the SRI with agents that have mood stabilizing properties, such as valproate or lamotrigine. {limited research}<br />
                   <br />
                   <span style="color: #ff8b00"><strong>No response to SRI treatment</strong></span><strong><br />
                   </strong> — For individuals who are unresponsive to the initial serotonergic reuptake inhibitor (SRI) agent in addition to adjunctive CBT, we suggest tapering off of the first agent and titrating another SRI. <br />
                   <br />
                In our clinical experience, <span style="color: #ff0000">a substantial proportion of patients with GAD do not improve</span> or have residual symptoms despite multiple trials of medications and augmenting agents. <br />
                  <br />
                  As an example, in an individual with prominent sleep disturbance, we might choose mirtazapine <br />
                  In an individual with depressed mood, we might use vortioxetine “Twintellix” or imipramine. <br />
                  ●<br />
                  Imipramine “Tofranil” – A tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), has been shown to be efficacious in treatment of patients with GAD<br />
                  <br />
                  Vilazodone “Luvox”, vortioxetine Twintellix– Clinical trials have found vilazodone, an SSRI and a 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, to be as efficacious as other SRIs in GAD <br />
                  <br />
                  Antipsychotics — Another potential pharmacologic treatment strategy for treatment-resistant GAD is the use of the second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) medications. We usually use SGAs, for example, <br />
                  1. 
                  quetiapine “Seroquel” or <br />
                  2. aripiprazole “Ability ?” adjunctively as augmentation of antidepressants. <br />
                  However, they can be used as monotherapy in patients who have had little to no response to prior drug trials.</p>
                <p>As an example, quetiapine can be started at 25 mg/day and titrated by 25 to 50 mg every one to two weeks to a maximum dose of 300 mg/day if tolerated [58]. (See &quot;Second-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;.)</p>

                  we suggest aerobic exercise for treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in patients who are medically capable. <br />

                <p><span style="color: #ff00ff">In particular, high-intensity exercise appears to be more effective than low-intensity as a complement to first-line therapy for GAD [70]. <br />
                  <br />
                  Mindfulness-based stress reduction and yoga may also be helpful, as they have also been shown to reduce symptoms of generalized anxiety relative to education control conditions [71,72].<br />
                  <br />
                  DURATION OF TREATMENT<br />
                  Pharmacotherapy — If effective, antidepressant treatment for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) should be continued for at least 12 months. <br />
                  <br />
                  If the patient experiences a relapse following termination of an effective medication, the length of treatment can be extended. After two relapses when tapering off the medication, ongoing maintenance treatment is suggested. <br />

                  Asian Americans – rarely seen<br />

  <br />
  MERCK<br />
  <br />
  Erectile dysfunction (ED—formerly called impotence) affects up to 20 million men in the US. The prevalence of partial or complete ED is &gt; 50% in men aged 40 to 70, and prevalence increases with aging. Most affected men can be successfully treated<br />
  <br />
The most common <strong>vascular cause</strong> is atherosclerosis of cavernous arteries of the penis, often caused by smoking, endothelial dysfunction, and diabetes. Atherosclerosis and aging decrease the capacity for dilation of arterial blood vessels and smooth muscle relaxation, limiting the amount of blood that can enter the penis (see <a href="https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/genitourinary-disorders/male-sexual-dysfunction/overview-of-male-sexual-function#v8335144" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Erection" data-id="182d8292-6ab8-4c6d-9be8-5af726f8c50f" data-itemid="bf51143b-d539-4ac2-8e73-5d58a4157927">Overview of Male Sexual Function: Erection</a>). Endothelial dysfunction is a disease of the endothelial lining of the small arterioles that reduces the ability to vasodilate when needed to increase blood flow. Endothelial dysfunction appears to be mediated by reduced levels of nitric oxide and can result from smoking, diabetes, and/or low <span data-showrollover="false">testosterone</span> levels. Veno-occlusive dysfunction permits venous leakage, which results in inability to maintain erection<br />

<br />
<strong>Neurologic causes</strong> include stroke, partial complex seizures, multiple sclerosis, peripheral and autonomic neuropathies, and spinal cord injuries. Diabetic neuropathy and surgical injury are particularly common causes.<br />
<br />
Prolonged perineal pressure (as occurs during bicycle riding) or pelvic or perineal trauma can cause ED.<br />
<br />
Any endocrinopathy or aging with <span data-showrollover="false">testosterone</span> deficiency ( <a href="https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/genitourinary-disorders/male-reproductive-endocrinology-and-related-disorders/male-hypogonadism" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Male Hypogonadism" data-id="242407d4-1b84-4d93-9c84-687984c77154" data-itemid="08c92c5b-1f0a-4515-baac-2111cc9d440a">hypogonadism</a>) may decrease libido and cause ED. However, erectile function only rarely improves with normalization of serum <span data-showrollover="false">testosterone</span> levels because most affected men also have neurovascular causes of ED.<br />
<br />
Some MEDICATIONS can also cause. Antidepressant, some betablockers, some diuretics (lasix, thiazide), spironolactone<br />

<br />
Examination is focused on the genitals and extragenital signs of hormonal, neurologic, and vascular disorders. Genitals are examined for anomalies, signs of <a href="https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/genitourinary-disorders/male-reproductive-endocrinology-and-related-disorders/male-hypogonadism" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Male Hypogonadism" data-id="929e80c6-c3fc-4537-b1b9-4e2a00504c60" data-itemid="08c92c5b-1f0a-4515-baac-2111cc9d440a">hypogonadism</a>, and fibrous bands or plaques ( <a href="https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/genitourinary-disorders/penile-and-scrotal-disorders/peyronie-disease" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Peyronie Disease" data-id="7591d5fa-e2e9-4dfb-91ed-a0c91ac07fb7" data-itemid="7dd0a17b-6536-4d76-89d1-ebb21642308e">Peyronie disease</a>). Poor rectal tone, decreased perineal sensation, or abnormal bulbocavernosus reflexes may indicate neurologic dysfunction. Diminished peripheral pulses suggest vascular dysfunction<br />
<br />

<br />
Laboratory assessment should include measurement of morning <span data-showrollover="false">testosterone</span> level; if the level is low or low-normal, <a href="https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/genitourinary-disorders/male-reproductive-endocrinology-and-related-disorders/male-hypogonadism#v1050865" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Diagnosis of primary and secondary hypogonadism" data-id="6de92b69-d2f3-4236-8b5f-978efcd7e806" data-itemid="08c92c5b-1f0a-4515-baac-2111cc9d440a">prolactin and luteinizing hormone</a> (LH) should be measured. Evaluation for occult diabetes, dyslipidemias, hyperprolactinemia, thyroid disease, and Cushing syndrome should be done based on clinical suspicion<br />
<br />
Currently, duplex ultrasonography after intracavernous injection of a vasodilatory drug such as a mixture of prostaglandin E1, papaverine, and phentolamine (available commercially as a combination product) is most often used to evaluate penile vasculature. <br />
<br />
<br />
Treatment</p>
<p>There are several treatment that will not be discuss such as penile injections.<br />
  <br />
  <strong>Oral phosphodiesterase inhibitors</strong> selectively inhibit cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)–specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the predominant phosphodiesterase isomer in the penis. These drugs include sildenafil, vardenafil, avanafil, and tadalafil(see table <a href="https://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/genitourinary-disorders/male-sexual-dysfunction/erectile-dysfunction#v8335189" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Oral Phosphodiesterase Type 5 Inhibitors for Erectile Dysfunction" data-id="f1770229-9b40-4095-84a1-a6441795b241" data-itemid="43a56400-2b00-4417-a887-0799df41c7f4">Oral Phosphodiesterase Type 5 Inhibitors for Erectile Dysfunction</a>). By preventing the hydrolysis of cGMP, these drugs promote the cGMP-dependent smooth muscle relaxation that is essential for normal erection. Although vardenafil and tadalafil are more selective for the penile vasculature than sildenafil, clinical responses and adverse effects of these drugs are similar. In comparative clinical trials, these drugs show comparable efficacy (60 to 75%<br />
  <br />
  All PDE5 inhibitors cause direct coronary vasodilation and potentiate the hypotensive effects of other nitrates, including those used to treat coronary artery disease. The concomitant use of nitrates and PDE5 inhibitors can be dangerous and should be avoided. Patients who only occasionally use nitrates (eg, for rare bouts of angina) should discuss the risks, selection, and proper timing of possible PDE5 inhibitor use with a cardiologist<br />
  <br />
  Adverse effects of PDE5 inhibitors include flushing, visual abnormalities, hearing loss, dyspepsia and headache. Sildenafil and vardenafil may cause abnormal color perception (blue haze). Tadalafil use has been linked with myalgias. Rarely, nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) has been associated with PDE5 inhibitor use, but a causal relationship has not been established. All PDE5 inhibitors should be administered cautiously and at lower initial dosages to patients receiving alpha-blockers (eg, prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin) because of the risk of hypotension. Patients taking an alpha-blocker should wait at least 4 hours before using a PDE5 inhibitor. Rarely, PDE5 inhibitors cause priapism<br />

                <p><strong style="color: #ff8c00">Diagnosis:</strong><br />
                </p>
<p>Most cases of primary genital herpes do not cause noticeable symptoms; many people infected with HSV-2 do not know that they have genital herpes. </p>
                <p>Primary genital lesions develop 4 to 7 days after contact. The vesicles usually erode to form ulcers that may coalesce. Lesions may occur in the following locations:</p>
                <p> On the prepuce, glans penis, and penile shaft in men</p>
                <p>On the labia, clitoris, perineum, vagina, and cervix in women</p>
                <p>Around the anus and in the rectum in men or women who engage in receptive rectal intercourse</p>
                <p>urinary hesitancy, dysuria, urinary retention, constipation, or severe sacral neuralgia may occur. </p>
                <p><strong style="color: #ff8c00">TESTS</strong></p>
                <p>Diagnosis of genital herpes is often clinical based on characteristic lesions; clusters of vesicles or ulcers on an erythematous base are unusual in genital ulcers other than those due to HSV. However, these lesions are absent in many patients.</p>
                <p>Tests for HSV should be done to confirm the diagnosis if it is not clear.</p>
                <p>Testing is usually done using a sample of fluid from the base of a vesicle or of a newly ulcerated lesion, if present. Absence of HSV in culture, especially in patients without active lesions, does not rule out HSV infection because viral shedding is intermittent. Also, culture has limited sensitivity; PCR is more sensitive and is being used increasingly.</p>
                <p>Direct immunofluorescence with fluorescein-labeled monoclonal antibodies is sometimes available; it is specific but not sensitive.</p>
                <p>Serologic tests can accurately detect HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies, which develop during the first several weeks after infection and then persist. Thus, if genital herpes is thought to be recently acquired, tests may have be repeated to allow time for seroconversion. </p>

                <p>Genital herpes is treated with antiviral drugs. </p>
                <p><strong>Primary eruptions</strong> can be treated with one of the following:</p>
                <p>Acyclovir 400 mg orally 3 times a day for 7 to 10 days</p>
                <p>Valacyclovir 1 g orally every 12 hours for 7 to 10 days</p>
                <p>Famciclovir 250 mg orally 3 times a day for 7 to 10 days</p>
                <p>These drugs reduce viral shedding and symptoms in severe primary infections. However, even early treatment of primary infections does not prevent recurrences.</p>
                <p>In <strong>recurrent eruptions,</strong> symptom duration and severity can be reduced marginally by antiviral treatment, particularly during the prodromal phase. Recurrent eruptions can be treated with one of the following:</p>
                <p>Acyclovir 400 mg orally 3 times a day for 5 days</p>
                <p>Valacyclovir 500 mg orally every 12 hours for 3 days</p>
                <p>Famciclovir 1000 mg orally every 12 hours for 1 day</p>
                <p><strong>For frequent eruptions (eg, &gt; 6 eruptions a year), suppressive antiviral therapy with one of the following may be used:</strong></p>
                <p>Acyclovir 400 mg orally every 12 hours</p>
                <p>Valacyclovir 500 to 1000 mg orally once a day                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Famciclovir 250 mg orally every 12 hours<br />
                  <br />
                  Doses should be adjusted for renal insufficiency. Adverse effects are infrequent with oral administration but may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and rash<br />

                    Diagnosis<br />
                    <br />
                    The saline wet mount is examined microscopically as soon as possible to detect trichomonads, which can become immotile and more difficult to recognize within minutes after slide preparation.<br />
                    <br />
                    Alternatively, <strong>immunochromographic flow dipstick tests</strong> or <strong>NAATs,</strong> which are available from some laboratories, may be done. In women, these tests are more sensitive than microscopic examination or culture<br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Culture of urine or urethral swabs</strong> is the only validated test for detecting <em>T. vaginalis</em> in men<br />
                    <br />
                    Oral metronidazole or tinidazole {rarely used}<br />
                    <br />
                  </li>
                  <li>Metronidazole or tinidazole 2 g orally in a single dose cures up to 95% of women with trichomoniasis if sex partners are treated simultaneously. Effectiveness of single-dose regimens in men is not as clear, so treatment is typically with metronidazole or tinidazole 500 mg orally twice a day for 5 to 7 days<br />
                    <br />
                    If infection persists in women and reinfection by sex partners has been excluded, women are retreated first with metronidazole or tinidazole 2 g orally once or metronidazole 500 mg twice a day for 7 days. If the initial retreatment regimen fails, metronidazole or tinidazole 2 g once a day for 5 days may be effective<br />
                    <br />
                    Metronidazole may cause leukopenia, <span data-showrollover="false">disulfiram</span>-like reactions to alcohol, or candidal superinfections. It is relatively contraindicated during early pregnancy, although it may not be dangerous to the fetus after the 1st trimester. Tinidazole has not been established as safe during pregnancy and so is not used                  </li>

                <h4>Medical Therapy</h4>
                <p>No drugs have been approved in the U.S. to treat PE. Still, there are a number of drugs, numbing creams and numbing sprays that may slow ejaculation in men with PE.</p>
                <h5>Drugs</h5>
                <p>Doctors noticed that men and women on antidepressants have delayed orgasms. Drugs such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, clomipramine and tramadol affect serotonin levels. Some doctors use these drugs &quot;off-label&quot; (for a different reason than the drug's original use) to treat PE. If one drug does not work, your doctor may suggest you try a different drug.</p>
                <p>For others, α1-Adrenoceptor antagonists are another option for drug therapy. These drugs may induce ejaculatory dysfunction such as retrograde ejaculation and/or failure of emission.</p>
                <p>Drugs for PE can be taken each day or only before sex. Your health care provider will suggest when you should take a drug based on your activity level. The best time to take the drug is not clear. Most doctors suggest from 2 to 6 hours before sex. PE can return if you stop taking these drugs. Most men with PE need to take these drugs on an ongoing basis.</p>
                <h5>Numbing Creams or Sprays</h5>
                <p>Numbing creams and sprays may be put on the head of the penis about 20 to 30 minutes before sex. If you leave the numbing cream/spray on your penis for longer than suggested, your erection may go away. Also, the numbing cream/spray should not be left on the exposed penis during vaginal sex because it may cause vaginal numbness. Wash the cream off your penis 5 to 10 minutes before sex. Wearing a condom can also help dull sensation.</p>
                <p><br />
  With the techniques listed here, about 95 out of 100 men will recover from PE. There is no way to promise recovery, but learning how to relax may help. If the problem stays, keep working with your health care provider to find solutions.<br />

                  aginal vulvar pruritus, burning, or irritation (which may be worse during intercourse) and dyspareunia are common, as is a thick, white, cottage cheese–like vaginal discharge that adheres to the vaginal walls.

                  Keeping the vulva clean and wearing loose, absorbent cotton clothing that allows air to circulate can reduce vulvar moisture and fungal growth<br />
                  <br />
                  requent recurrences require long-term suppression with oral drugs (fluconazole 150 mg weekly to monthly or ketoconazole 100 mg once a day for 6 months). Suppression is effective only while the drugs are being taken. These drugs may be contraindicated in patients with liver disorders. Patients taking ketoconazole should be monitored periodically with liver function tests.</p>

<p align="left"><strong><em>1.</em></strong> Apthous Ulcers: WARNING: Bechet sndrome. Usually lesions also present, on genital, around eyes, on skin, and may have neurological, vascular, and arthritic manifestation. The specific cause is unknown. Stress seems to be indicated. Familial tendency. Round, yellow-gray ulcers are present on the oral mucosa, with erythematous halo. Usually 3-5 mm. Diagnosis is clinical. Treatment: Usually, corticosteroid ointment or doxycycline ointment. Prednisone tablets 25 mg/day x 2 weeks witha taper down--for very bad cases (this may indicate a need for a biopsy). Specific treatment: </p>
<p>●<strong>Triamcinolone</strong><strong> acetonide 0.1% in Orabase</strong> – Orabase is a thick, paste-like material that may adhere better to isolated lesions but does not appeal to many patients. Apply tid.</p>
<p><strong>Dexamethasone</strong><strong> elixir 0.5 mg/5 cc</strong> – 5 mL swish and spit three to four times daily. It is important to keep the medication in the mouth for five minutes prior to spitting it out. Do not rinse afterward and avoid eating or drinking for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>●<strong>Clobetasol</strong><strong> 0.05% gel or ointment</strong> – Apply a small amount to the area of involvement two to three times daily. This will work better if the mucosa is dried with a piece of gauze prior to the application of the medication. Do not rinse afterward and avoid eating or drinking for 30 minutes.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>1A. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada, I'm 19 year old and I would like to know: What can I do if I think I have COVID?</strong></p>
<p align="left">Possible microbes involved: COVID 19 (originial), COVID (Delta), COVID (2BA)--alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, eta, iota, kappa, mu(uptodate)<br />
</p>
<p align="left">Nurse Practitioner: The Symptoms of COVID are many. They include the following: fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, nasal congestion or rhinorrhea, vomiting or diarrhea, and skin rashes (source: CDC). Because the symptoms of COVID resemble so many other illnesses, in most cases, the first step in any illness these days in 2022 should be to test one self for COVID, or to get test tested for COVID.</p>
<p align="left">If a COVID test is positive, the next step is do get some medication to control the replication of COVID. ____(Paxlovid, sotrovimab, Veklury (remdesivir),  _____Nirmatrelvir (Paxlovid) and molnupiravir are pills that have been approved by the FDA and are available at pharmacies. The exact availability may vary until the makers of the pills are able to keep up with the demand--but, this is the suggested treatment and an effort to obtain and take this type of medication is recommended. (source: uptodate)<br />
</p>
<p align="left">If a person is considered a high-risk of complications from COVID, or has not received any vaccinations, monoclonal antibodies should be considered. There approximatel 5 of these. However, they are do NOT all work equally. Because COVID variants continue to occur, and different ones become dominat, NOT all monoclonal antibodies work. Bebtolovimab and Sotrovimab does work against the ommicron variant, BUT bamlanivimab/etesevimab and casirivimab/imdevimab combinations do NOT. Sotrovimab  remdesivir</p>
<p align="left">However, the new strain of COVID that is becoming more dominant is COVID 2AB. <em>There is no published articles on the Internet that states which monoclonal antibody will be effective for this variant at that time this website is being published.</em> Sotrovimab works against COVID omnicron, BUT NOT COVID 2BA. Imdevimab works against Omincron/BA.2 but not against Omincron/BA.1</p>
<p align="left">On Feb 12, 2022 The FDA gave emergency use authorization (EUA) for bebtelovimab is for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms, which is about 88 pounds) with a positive COVID-19 test, and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death (source: www.fda.gov/news). HOWEVER, at that time that website is being published, its effectiveness against omicron/BA.2 is not known.</p>
<p align="left">Also in Feb of 2022, the FDA revised the authorizations for two monoclonal antibody treatments – bamlanivimab and etesevimab (administered together) and REGEN-COV (casirivimab and imdevimab) – to limit their use to only when the patient is likely to have been infected with or exposed to a variant that is susceptible to these treatments. </p>
<p align="left">Therefore, the use of monoclonal antibodies must be determined by an expert physician such as Infectious Disease doctor.</p>

<p align="left">Because the cause of a sore throat is usually a virus, the first treatment for a sore throat is to try to reduce the pain.  The safest medication to treat pain unless a person has a liver problem or has an allergy to Tylenol, is Tylenol.  </p>
<p align="left">If that is NOT successful, then some form of ibuprofen can be tried, provided a person does not have a kidney problem, a stomach problem, an allergy to ibuprofen, or is in the last three months of a pregnancy.</p>
<p align="left">Sometimes, a low dose of oral corticosteroids can be given to reduce swelling and pain.</p>
<p align="left">Sometimes, an anesthetic spray, or an anesthetic mouth rinse can be used to reduce pain. </p>
<p align="left">If it is suspected that a person has sore throat because of group A Beta Hemalytic Streptococcus bacteria, the most common antibiotics that are used are amoxicillin, penicillin, keflex, and azithromycin.  These antibiotics have some risks such as killing off some good bacteria that the body normally has and allergic reaction.</p>
<p align="left">If the sore throat is occuring in a teenager, and the teenager reports that they are exceptionally tired, the diagnosis of Mononucleosis (Mono) should also be considered. There is a blood simple blood test to determine if likely. Since Mono is a virus it will not respond to antibiotics such as Amoxicillin, and it generally last much longer than other type of sore throat (a month or more). The primary treatment for Mononucleosis is pain management and rest.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>1B. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada, I'm 19 year old and I would like to know: What can I do for a sore throat?</strong></p>
<p align="left">Possible microbes involved: Group A Beta Hemolytic Streptococcus, Gonorrhea, Diptheria, Fusobacteria necrophorum, Staphylococcus, Epstein–Barr_virus (Mono), Human cytomegalovirus (mono), Adenovirus, Herpes Simplex, Coxsackieviruses A &amp; B, HIV, Influenza Aor B, COVID 19<br />
</p>
<p align="left">Nurse Practitioner: About 90% of the time a sore throat is caused by a common virus (usally adenovirus) that the body will fight off by itself.  When it is not caused by a virus, it is usually caused by bacteria.  Usually, the bacteria is Group A betahemalytic streptococcus.  And when it is neither of these, then it is usally Mononucleosis caused by either Epstein-Barr Virus or Human Cytomegalovirus. However, there are some other less common causes such as gonorrhea, diptheira, and fusobacteira necrophorum.<br />
</p>
<p align="left">Because the cause of a sore throat is usually a virus, the first treatment for a sore throat is to try to reduce the pain.  The safest medication to treat pain unless a person has a liver problem or has an allergy to Tylenol, is Tylenol.  </p>
<p align="left">If that is NOT successful, then some form of ibuprofen can be tried, provided a person does not have a kidney problem, a stomach problem, an allergy to ibuprofen, or is in the last three months of a pregnancy.</p>
<p align="left">Sometimes, a low dose of oral corticosteroids can be given to reduce swelling and pain.</p>
<p align="left">Sometimes, an anesthetic spray, or an anesthetic mouth rinse can be used to reduce pain. </p>
<p align="left">If it is suspected that a person has sore throat because of group A Beta Hemalytic Streptococcus bacteria, the most common antibiotics that are used are amoxicillin, penicillin, keflex, and azithromycin.  These antibiotics have some risks such as killing off some good bacteria that the body normally has and allergic reaction.</p>
<p align="left">If the sore throat is occuring in a teenager, and the teenager reports that they are exceptionally tired, the diagnosis of Mononucleosis (Mono) should also be considered. There is a blood simple blood test to determine if likely. Since Mono is a virus it will not respond to antibiotics such as Amoxicillin, and it generally last much longer than other type of sore throat (a month or more). The primary treatment for Mononucleosis is pain management and rest.</p>

<p><strong>2. Henrietta from Pittsburgh, PA ask: What is the treatment for sinus infection</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>2. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada, I'm 29 year old and I would like to know: What can I do for a sinus infection?</strong><br />
</p>
<p align="left">Possible Microbes: Adenovirus, , staphyloccocci, streptococci, pneumococci, Heamophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarhalix, or Fungi (Mucormcosis, Aspergillosis and Candida)</p>
<p align="left">Nurse Practitioner: About 98% of the time a sinus pressure is caused by a common virus that the body will fight off by itself.  When it is not caused by a virus, it usually caused by bacteria.  Usually, the bacteria is either streptococci, pneumococci, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Moraxella catarrhalis,</em> or staphylococci.  However, there are some other less common causes such as a fungal infection, seen mostly in people who are immune suppressed. </p>
<p align="left">Because the cause of sinusitis is usually a virus, the first treatment for sinus pressure is generally to manage symptoms. </p>
<p align="left">If a person is not allergic to Tylenol and has no liver conditions, then Tylenol is a good mediction to start with. </p>
<p align="left">If that is unsuccessful, and the person has no allergy to Motrin and also does not have any stomach or kidney problems--and is not in the last three months of pregnancy, then the person can take Motrin. </p>
<p align="left">Nasal decongestants are usually tried--provided there are no known sensitivities or allergies to these medications such as feeling extremely anxious. These medications are medications such as pseudofedrine tablets and or Afrin nasal sprays taken as directed.<br />
</p>
<p align="left">If it is suspected that a person has a bacterial sinus infections an antibiotic should be tried. Over the past 10 years different antibiotics have been suggested as the first antibiotic to be used. These days most textbooks recommend using Augmentin 875 mg twice a day, as the first antibiotic of choicel however, Augmentin is more likely to cause side effects (nausea and diarrhea) than many other antibiotics. Other antibiotics that are commonly used are Doxycycline, Levofloxacin, and Amoxicillin. Sometimes, two antibiotics are used at the same time, such as levofloxacin or clindamycin <strong>AND</strong>  cefixime or cefpodoxime. All antibiotics have some risks  such as killing off some good bacteria that the body has and causing an allergic reaction. The use of a particular antibiotic should consider the degree of the patients illness, their tolerance to antibiotics in the past, and cost.</p>
<p align="left">There are three clusters of symptoms to look for to determine if you need an antibiotic: You may need an antibiotic is have the combination of the following symptoms.</p>
<p align="left">A. Sinus pressure (in one area of the face), severe nasal discharge or congestion, a fever or 102 or greater for three days or more (if not taking antipyretics)</p>
<p align="left">B. Sinus pressure (in one area of the face), severe nasal discharge or congestion, and 3-4 of feeling bad, then a couple days of feeling good, then feeling bad again, usually worse than the initial illness</p>
<p align="left">C. Sinus pressure (in one are of the face), severe nasal discharge or congestion, and 10 or more symptoms that do not seem to be getting better</p>
<p align="left">* A complaint of sinus pain in more than part of the face is usually not a bacterial infection, it is usually do to a viral infection, which will usually go away by itself with the proper rest and time. </p>

<p>3. <strong>Henrietta from Pittsburgh, PA ask: What is the treatment for ear pain</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>3. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada, I'm 50 year old and I would like to know: What can I do for ear pain?</strong></p>
<p align="left">Possible Microbes: <br />
</p>
<p align="left">Nurse Practitioner: <em>Review ??? Ear pain has a variety of causes. About 90% of the time a sore throat is caused by a common virus that the body will fight off by itself.  When it is not caused by a virus, it usually caused by bacteria.  Usually, the bacteria is Group A betahemalytic streptococcus.  However, there are some other less common causes such as gonorrhea, diptheira, fusobacteira, herpes simplex Type 6. ______ </em></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">For children, it is more common to have an ear infection. For adults, ear infections are less common.  Adults are more likely to have ear pain as a result of a eustation tube dysfunction, which causes air to be trapped behind the ear drum, which then causes pain. Also, it relatively common for adults to have wax buildup in their ear canals, and even a small amount of wax can sometimes cause pain in the ear canal.</p>
<p align="left">For these reasons, the first treatment ear pain is generally to manage symptoms. If a person is not allergic to Tylenol and has no liver conditions, then Tylenol is a good mediction to start with. If that is unsuccessful, and the person has no allerg to Motrin and also does not have any stomach or kidney problems--and is not in the last three months of pregnancy, then the person can take Motrin. In addition, nasal decongestants can be tried--provided there are no known sensitivities or allergies to these medications such as feeling extremely anxious. These medications are pseudofedrine tablets and or Afrin nasal sprays taken as directed. And these medications can sometimes reduce the inflammation and swelling of the eustachian tube (the tube that connect the inside part of the ear with the mouth and allows the middle ear to adjust its pressure). This will then decrease pain by allowing the excess pressure -- or lack of pressure in the middle ear to properly equalize, reducing the pressure on the ear drum.</p>
<p align="left">It should be mentioned that although benzocaine ear drops have been tried--the effectiveness of these ear drops has not been successfully demonstrated by clinical studies. There is also a risk that if a person's ear pain is due to hole in the ear drum, those ear drops could travel to the middle ear where they might cause some harm.</p>
<p align="left">Since a large percentage of patients, especially adults who have recently had a cold, have a eustachian tube dysfuction--rather than an ear infection, the most commonly prescribed medications for this disorder is psuedofedrine and Afrin nasal spray--used as directed.</p>
<p align="left">Ear drum infections or middle ear infection are relatively easy to see with an otoscope and a little training; the ear drum is usually dull to bright red and bulging. Thus, this diagnosis is usually fairly easy for a doctor to make when a person is seen in the office. If a person is suspected of having an ear drum infection, it is usually caused by a bacterial infection usually Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus (source AAFP). The treatment is with antibiotics, Amoxicillin and Azithroymcin are used most commonly.</p>
<p align="left">If there seems to be more pain on the outside of the ear than the inside of the ear, there is more likely an infection in the ear canal. The treatment is usually antibiotic drops such Ciprofloxacin, 2. ______ and 3. ______.</p>
<p align="left">If there is a history of ear wax build up and no other obvious symptoms of infections such as a fever or recent cold, then there is an increased likelihood that the ear pain is due to ear wax build up. The treatment for this is removing the wax. If there no evidence of there being a hole in the eardrum, no event that caused a sudden loss of hearing, no history of a buildup of pain in the ear and a sudden decrease of pain, and the patient is <strong>NOT </strong>able to force air out of his ears (which is possible if there is a hole in the ear drum), then a person can try to remove wax from his ears himself. For mild cases of ear wax buildup a person can usually use some debrox ear drops, which is a solution to help liquify the wax in the ear drum and wait patiently for several days. A person who is reasonably sure that they don't have a hole in their ear drum can also try squirting some WARM water in their ear to remove the water. If that is insufficient, then the person should have a professional remove the wax for them.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>1. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada, I'm 19 year old and I would like to know: What can I do for a eye infection?</strong></p>
<p align="left">Possible Bateria or viruses involved: <br />
</p>
<p align="left">Nurse Practitioner: About __% what looks like an eye infection is infection caused by a bacteria and will respond to antibiotic eye drops. The vast majority of other discharge from the eye or eyes is caused by a virus, usually the _______ virus. If the eye discharge is due to ____ virus, it will usually resolve within a few days by with rest, much they same as a person recovers from a cold.   However, there are some other less common causes such as gonorrhea, allergies, irritation from wind or cold. </p>
<p align="left">WARNING:  There are three symptoms that are not associated with a simple eye infection, and are strong indications that a person needs to be seen within a few hours from the start of their symptoms: 1. Eye Pain 2. Change of Vision 3. _a possibility that something flew into their eye______ . If any of these occur a person should be seen by someone who has a ___ slit lamp__ (optometrist, opthalmologist, emergency room with a slit lamp). This must be done to make certain that a person does not permanently lose their sight. <br />
</p>
<p align="left">For these reasons, the first treatment SHOULD NOT be  to reduce the pain.  If there is significant pain, a person must be appropriately with a ___slit lamp. </p>
<p align="left">If it is suspected that a person has an eye infection because of __________ bacteria, the most commonly used antibiotics to use are antibiotic eye drops such as the following: Tobramycin, Polymyin B and Trimethoprim</strong>, Gentamycin, Ciprofloxacin, Azithromycin. As always, there is a chance of an allergic reaction to these eyedrops.</p>
<p align="left">Since these antibiotics are not system their is little risk of these medications killing the good bacteria of the body.</p>

<p><strong>5.  Henrietta from Pittsburgh, PA ask: What is the treatment for head lice?</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>1. I live in Phoenix, Arixona, I'm 22 year old and I would like to know: What can I do for a head lice?</strong></p>
<p align="left">Possible Microbes involved: <br />
</p>
<p align="left">Nurse Practitioner:  Many times people who an itchy scalp think that they may have head lice--when they actually don't have head lice. So, before possibly wasting a lot of time and energy treating possible lice, let's talk about a good way to check for head lice. </p>
<p align="left">The best way to check for head lice is to ask a friend to put gloves on their hands and examine your hair close to the scalp. The best way to do this is by using a comb and creating parts about 1/2 in from one to the next part. You are looking for a small crawling bug or a lice egg (called a nit). The lice itself looks like a tiny dark ant, about 1 mm by 3 mm. However, it is more likely to find a nit than a living lice. It clings to the base of a hair shaft--not the long ends of the hair so don't waste time going through the long ends of the hair, just look closely at the base of hair shafts. The nit is dark, and about 1 mm by 2-3 mm. If you find something that looks like a nit, try to pull it off the hair. If it sticks to the hair like gum, but comes off, it is probably a nit, and it means the person probably does have lice and it requires treatment.</p>
<p align="left">The treatment for head lice is anyone of a five over-the-counter medications such as A–200, Pronto, R&amp;C, Rid, Triple X. However, they only kill live lice--not nits. Because of this a second dose is often needed 9-10 days later. <strong>Permethrin lotion 1%</strong> is a prescription medication that ALSO only kills live lice; so a second treatment 9 days later is highly suggested. The advantage of Permethrin is that is more gentle than the other medications and for this reason can be used on children as young as 2 months old. Most over-the-counter products are not recommended for children under 2 years of age. There are still other prescription medications available if a person's lice seems to be resistant to other medications (source CDC). Usually, if a person is NOT allergic to the anti-lice lotion, it will not do any harm. Therefore, if there is doubt whether a person still has lice after 9 days, then a second treatment is recommended. </p>
<p align="left">Machine Wash at 130°F and dry with High Heat. It is important to not only use the medications as ordered but also to machine wash and dry clothing, bed linens, and other items that an infested person wore or used during the 2 days before treatment (Source CDC)  </p>
<p align="left">Or seal in a plastic bag for 2 weeks: For items that can not be dry cleaned or laundered then put them in a plastic bag and seal it for two weeks. That will alco kill lice.</p>
<p align="left">Vacumn carpets and sofas--but there is no need to spend a lot of time and energy on cleaning them more thoroughly. (Source CDC)</p>

<p><strong>6. Henrietta from Pittsburgh, PA ask: What is the treatment for neck pain</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>1. I live in Phoenix, Arizona, I'm 50 year old and I would like to know: What can I do for a Neck Pain?</strong></p>
<p align="left">Possible Bateria or viruses involved: <br />
</p>
<p align="left">Nurse Practitioner: The vast majority of people who complain of neck pain have a simple muscle strain or ligament sprain in their neck. However, there are some other really bad causes of neck pain such as meningitis, West Nile encephalitis, mouth cancer, throat cancer, and damaged neck bones. This website can not discuss all of the evaluations and treatments for all of the reasons for neck pain--but will discuss the treatments for a suspected neck pain due to either a sprain or a strain. Neck pain that is  associated with any high risk symptos such as recent trauma that might occur from a car accident, or afte a fall, a recent or current illness, a history of easily bronken bones, pain radiating down an arm. All of these symptoms, would necessitate an evaluation in person.</p>
<p align="left">The first treatments that should be considered are either heat or cold treatment, or alternating heat and cold(Source: healtline.com). Usually no more than 15 - 20 minutes of each per hour (Source: southernpainclinic.com)</p>
<p align="left">For these reasons, the first treatment for a sore throat is to try to reduce the pain.  The safest medication to treat pain unless a person has a liver problem or has an allergy to Tylenol, is Tylenol.  </p>
<p align="left">If that is unsuccessful, then some form of ibuprofen can be tried, provided a person does not have a kidney problem, a stomach problem, an allergy to ibuprofen, or is in the last three months of a pregnancy.</p>
<p align="left">Other medications that are commonly presribed for strains and sprains are Flexeril and Robaxin, other NSAIDS (Metaxall, Skelaxin) (Steroids are not recommended (source: Merck Manual)</p>
<p align="left">WARNING: Robaxin and Flexeril may increase sleepiness; therefore, a person should not drive or do any activity that might result in an accident</p>

<p><strong>7. Henrietta from Pittsburgh, PA ask: What is the treatment for shoulder pain</strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>1. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada, I'm 19 year old and I would like to know: What can I do for a sore throat?</strong></p>
<p align="left">Possible Microbes involved: </p>
<p align="left">WARNING: In rare cases shoulder pain can be from: osteomyelitis (infection of the bone) and septic arthritis, ectopic pregancy, clavicular fractures, spleen ruptures, incranial hemrrhage, amoebic liver abscess, branchial plexus injury, cholecystitis, peritonitis, pleural effusion, unstable angina, and acute porphyria.<br />
</p>
<p align="left">Nurse Practitioner: Most of the time shoulder pain is due one or more of the structures in the shoulder being strained, torn, or inflammed. The structure involved can be either bones, tendons, or bursa. If one of the four tendons that holds the shoulder joint in placed it is called a rotator cuff injury. If the sac of fluid in the shoulder gets inflammed it is called bursitis. And if the bone is damaged it is called osteoarthritis, or osteophyte (bone spur).</p>
<p align="left">For these reasons, the first treatment for a shoulder pain is to try to reduce the pain.  The safest medication to treat pain unless a person has a liver problem or has an allergy to Tylenol, is Tylenol.  </p>
<p align="left">If that is unsuccessful, then some form of ibuprofen can be tried, provided a person does not have a kidney problem, a stomach problem, an allergy to ibuprofen, or is in the last three months of a pregnancy.</p>
<p align="left">Ice may be used for 15 minutes four times a day.</p>
<p align="left">Resting the shoulder is recommended. </p>
<p align="left">Slow specific exercises directed by a physical therapist may be helpful. Inappropriate exercises or exercise at high weight is usually counterproductive.</p>
<p align="left">Cortisone injections (but not cortisone pills) are sometimes helpful.</p>
<p align="left">Most of typical causes of shoulder pain have a known cause such as a fall, or over exercise. These generally do not require emergency treatment.</p>
<p align="left">However, shoulder pain that has no likely cause should be more quickly evaluated to make certain that it is not illness that is deadly: heart attack, blood infection, gallbladder infection, and others.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>1. I live in Las Vegas, Nevada, I'm 19 year old and I would like to know: What can I do for a sinus infection?</strong></p>
<p align="left">Possible Microbes involved: </p>
<p align="left">WARNING: There are a several very bad illnesses that untreated bacterial sinusitis can lead to. These are sinus cavernous thrombosis, a brain abscess, meningitis, and periorbital or orbital cellulitis. These rarely occur--but they do occur on occassion, and should be observed for. For this reason anyone experiencing the following symptoms should be seen relatively quickly (approximately within 8 hours of symptoms starting). These symptoms are: Proptosis (bulging eye), ptosis (dropping eye lid), chemosis (swelling of the white part of the eyes), and cranial nerve palsy (the eye will move irregularly).<br />
</p>
<p align="left">Nurse Practitioner: About 90% of the time a sore throat is caused by a common virus that the body will fight off by itself.  When it is not caused by a virus, it usually caused by bacteria.  Usually, the bacteria is Group A betahemalytic streptococcus.  However, there are some other less common causes such as gonorrhea, diptheira, fusobacteira, herpes simplex Type 6. ______ <br />
