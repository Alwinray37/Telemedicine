        WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF A COLD (also called an Upper Respiratory Infection?</h1>
      <h2>The most common symptoms of a Cold are a runny and stuffy nose.  Other symptoms that may occur are following: Sore throat, Cough, Congestion, mild body aches, mild headache, Sneezing, Low-grade fever (less than 101.2), and Generally not feeling well.      <br>

      <h2>About 50% of all colds are caused by one of the &gt; 100 serotypes of rhinoviruses—but it is difficult to tell one rhinovirus from another. A rhinovirus called “RV-C” was found the most common found in children admitted to Pediatric ICU.  Coronaviruses also cause some upper respiratory infections.  Other infections are caused by influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, and metapneumoviruses.  These viruses are usually spread from one person to another person by breathing the same air.<br>

      <td colspan="5"><h1>HOW IS A COLD DIAGNOSED?</h1>
      <h2>A cold is usually diagnosed by a careful history and a brief physical exam. However, because of the numerous cases of COVID-19 that have been occurring over the last couple of years, some medical professional are suggesting that a COVID test may be helpful because some COVID infections  can become life-threatening infections in hours to days, and early treatment of COVID symptoms reduces the chance of these life-threatening situations.  In addition, if a person has a sore throat, a strep test might be helpful.  Also, if it is Influenza season, a test for influenza might be done because some types of Influenza have mild symptoms, similar to cold symptoms.  Lastly, if a person is reporting extreme fatigue and a sore throat, a test for mononucleosis should be considered. <br>

      <td colspan="5"><h1>TREATMENTS FOR A COLD?</h1>
        <h2>1. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) as needed for fever and pain - If a person has no known Liver problems<br>
          </h2>
        <h2>2. NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) {Motrin, Advil, Aleve, etc.} as needed for fever and pain— If a person has no known kidney or stomach problems and is not in the third trimester of pregnancy.<br>
          </h2>
        <h2>3. Afrin Nasal Sprays as needed for nasal congestion.  While Afrin is often effective for a couple days, longer use can irritate the inside of the nose; therefore, this decongestant should be used sparingly and not for more than a few days.  Often one spray at a time is effective for nasal congestion relief--even though the directions say to use 2 sprays in both nostrils at one time.<br>
          </h2>
        <h2>4. Pseudofedrine as needed for nasal congestion. This decongestant is only sold from behind the pharmacy counter, you must ask for it.  Most people will find relief at the lowest dose of only 30 mg for 4 - 8 hours when needed. Higher doses are likely to cause anxiety and insomnia.  It is best to use this medication sparingly—although it can be used in low doses for months at a time (if necessary).<br>
          </h2>
        <h2>5. Chlorpheniramine can be used for excessive runny noses (rhinorrhea) - but it can cause drowsiness, and increased nasal congestion<br>
          </h2>
      <h2>6. Iptratopium bromide which requires a prescription; can be used for excessive rhinorrhea—but it is usually minimal effective ( 2 sprays of a 0.03% solution 2 or 3 times a day)</h2></td>

      <td colspan="5"><h4>1. Cold symptoms can sometimes be more than a cold.  For example, sometimes cold symptoms are caused by COVID or the Flu.  These illnesses not only put the person who is sick at risk for a life-threatening even—but it puts their contacts, especially those who are over 65 years, those less than 5 years, and those whose immune system is suppressed.<br>
          <br>
          2. A person should be aware of any symptoms that seem to be above and beyond that of a normal cold because they may indicate a possible life-threatening event in the near future.  Some symptoms that would indicate that an illness is more than a common cold are: shortness of breath, wheezing, symptoms that are getting worse after 2-3 days, fever greater than 101.3, severe sore throat, severe headache, or severe sinus pain.</h4>
        <h4>3. All medication, including all oral antibiotics and all medications that come in lotions, ointment, and creams have a risk of side effects.</h4>
        <h4> 4. Possible Mild side effects are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, itching, and light to moderate skin rash.<br>
      </h4>
        <h4>5. Possible Severe side effects are a severe skin rash, an anaphylactic allergic reaction (leading to the inability to breathe and subsequent death if not treated rapidly), and Clostridioides difficile infection (C. Diff.) of the colon.<br>
        </h4>
      <h4>6.  Medications such as creams, lotions, and gels should be tested in small dosages in areas of the body that are not easily seen.</h4></td>
