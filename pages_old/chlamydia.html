      <h2>The most common symptom of a Chlamydia is no symptoms at al—or almost no symptoms, which helps explains why it is spread so readily.  However, after some time the bacteria might infect more parts of both and men and women, and give them more symptoms, some of which are painful.  These symptoms include:  pain during urination, pain during sex, lower abdominal pain, a discharge from the vagina, the penis, or the rectum.  The discharge from a vagina is more likely to be a yellow color and have a smell. A discharge from a man’s penis is more likely to be clear or milky. If a testicle is infected, it will usually cause a swollen testicle.  If the cervix is infected, there can be lower abdominal pain, and bleeding in between menstrual periods.<br>

      <td colspan="5"><h1>WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF CHLAMYDIA?</h1>
        <h2>Chlamydia is caused by the bacteria Chlamydia Trachomatis. Even though there are other types of Chlamydial bacteria, Chlamydia Trachomatis is the most common and the one most people are referring to when they say “Chlamydia.”</h2>
      <h2>Chlamydia is spread from one person to another via sexual interactions.  It is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States. Once it is in a man’s body, it can spread  from the urethra to his testicles.  Once it is in a female’s body, it can spread from the vagina to the Cervix and Fallopian tubes.  In addition, it can spread into the urethra of a woman.<br>

      <td colspan="5"><h1>HOW IS CHLAMYDIA DIAGNOSED?</h1>
        <h2>Chlamydia is usually diagnosed by taking a careful history and by doing a laboratory test on the discharge that are secreted from the vagina, penis, anus, or pharynx (back of the throat). These test are called Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs) because these tests are more sensitive than cell cultures.  In some cases, all that is needed is a urine sample.  However, a urine sample will not dectect Chlamydia in the pharynx or the rectum.  For those areas, a swab must rub the area, be put in a special solution for transportation, and sent to the lab for the lab to test.</h2>
      <h2>However, a lab test is not always necessary.  An exception is if a person has symptoms, and has a partner who has recently tested positive for either Chlamydia or Gonorrhea, then this person can sometimes receive treatment without a lab test.<br>
