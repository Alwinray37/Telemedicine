                <div class="heading"><i class="fa-solid fa-1"></i> Determine if your illness is treatable with
                    telemedicine</div>
                <p>If you are able to correctly determine
                    whether your illness is treatable with
                    telemedicine or not, it will save you time
                    and energy.
                    <br><br>
                    A Telemedicine provider is capable of
                    making many common diagnosis—but he
                    or she is not capable to making complex
                    diagnosis that require special immediate
                    tests such as blood tests or X-rays.
                    <br><br>
                    For this reason, common diagnosis such as
                    strep throat, pinkeye, influenza, urinary
                    tract infections and various rashes are the
                    majority of diagnosis made by telemedicine 
                    providers.
                    <br><br>
                    Complex diagnosis such as dyspnea,
                    coronary artery disease, and abdominal
                    pain require special special tests, which
                    means they can not be made with
                    telemedicine.
                    <br><br>
                    To help you distinguish between illnesses
                    that are treatable with telemedicine and
                    those that are not, please look at my
                    website www.telemedicine.house
                    and see the list of illnesses that I am willing
                    to treat—and those that I am not willing to
                    treat.
                    <br><br>
                    Remember, it is very important to try
                    determine whether your illness is treatable
                    with telemedicine or not, because if you
                    ask for a treatment that a provider can NOT
                    safely give you, you will not only have
                    wasted your time, but you may have also
                    spent money for treatment which you did
                    
                    not receive.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="heading"><i class="fa-solid fa-2"></i> Take your vitals signs to determine how
                    sick you are</div>
                <p>Taking your vital signs is very important
                    because it provides a strong indication of
                    how ill you are. If your vital signs deviate
                    severely from the normal range, then you
                    should not delay your treatment with a
                    telemedicine visit. Rather, you should seek
                    immediate In-person treatment. The more
                    your vital signs deviate from the normal
                    range, the higher the level of treatment you
                    should seek.
                    <br><br>
                    However, mild deviations of your vital signs
                    are expected with mild to moderate illness.
                    Vital signs that are that mildly deviated
                    (either high or low) generally indicates that
                    you do NOT have to be seen immediately,
                    and you can USUALLY wait for a few
                    
                    hours, or a day or two.
                    <br><br>
                    There are 5 possible vitals signs:
                    <br>
                    1. Temperature<br>
                    2. Pulse rate<br>
                    3. Respiratory Rate<br>
                    4. Blood Pressure<br>
                    5. Oxygen Saturation<br>
                    <br>
                    The normal vital signs are the following:<br>
                    
                    Temperature: 97F to 99F<br>
                    Pulse rate: 60 - 100 beats/minute<br>
                    Respiratory Rate: 12- 16 respirations/
                    
                    minute
                    <br><br>
                    Blood Pressure: 90/50 to 120/80
                    Oxygen saturation: 95% to 100%
                    <br><br>
                    Mild deviations from these numbers often
                    occur when a person is ill, so they are
                    expected.
                    <br><br>
                    But, extreme deviations are not expected.
                    
                    These are the following:<br>
                    
                    Temperature greater than 103F<br>
                    
                    Pulse rate that is greater than 120 beats/
                    
                    minute
                    <br>
                    Respiration rate that is greater than 20/
                    
                    minute
                    <br>
                    Oxygen saturation level that is 94% or less
                    <br><br>
                    As a general rule, if any of these excessive
                    deviations occur, a person should go to an
                    urgent care or emergency room.
                    <br><br>
                    For all of these reason, you can see why it
                    is important to take your vital signs before
                    making a telemedicine appointment. As
                    mentioned before, if you suspect that you
                    have a severe illness, you should get
                    immediate in-person treatment—and not
                    waste your time and money with
                    telemedicine.</p>

                <p>The most confidential way to communicate
                    with a telemedicine provider is via “Zoom.”
                    You can download and open the Zoom app
                    on most smartphones and computers in a
                    just a few minutes.
                    <br><br>
                    There are excellent YouTube videos on the
                    web that explain how you can do this.

                <p>To schedule an appointment for a
                    telemedicine visit you will have to find a
                    telemedicine website such as mine.
                    <br><br>
                    Once you find a telemedicine website, you
                    will click on a tab that says “Schedule Your
                    Appointment.”
                    <br><br>
                    After that you will see a calendar. Click on
                    the date and time you want your
                    appointment.
                    <br><br>
                    You will then be ask to provide some
                    information about yourself. For example,
                    you will be ask to provide information such
                    as your name, email, telephone number,
                    and the name and location of the pharmacy
                    that you prefer.
                    <br><br>
                    After that, you will click on the “Schedule
                    Event” tab.
                    <br><br>
                    You will then be sent an email confirming
                    your appointment. That email will contain a

                <div class="heading"><i class="fa-solid fa-6"></i> Explain your illness to your provider</div>
                <p>The best way to explain your illness is say
                    how it started and then how it changed as
                    time progressed. For example, what were
                    your symptoms when your illness started,
                    what were the symptoms in the middle of
                    your illness, and what are they today. Your
                    provider will usually be able to make a
                    diagnosis based on your symptoms and
                    your vital signs. You will then be
                    prescribed a medication electronically. That
                    prescription will then be sent to the
                    pharmacy of your choosing.</p>

                    Usually, you will be given a variety of
