            <div class="step">
                <div class="number">1</div>
                <h4>Decide if Telemedicine is right for you</h4>
                <p>
                    The next very important step in using a telemedicine visit is to decide if your illness is treatable with a telemedicine visit. You don't want to waste your time and money with a telemedicine visit if the visit will not help you. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You must understand that telemedicine is usually only used for simple, straightforward, illness, that you can see with your without the use of an ophthalmoscope or stethoscope. Example of these diagnosis are strep throat, rashes, or pinkeye. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My website has a list of diagnosis that I personally believe are safe to treat with telemedicine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most doctors agree that Telemedicine should rarely be used for severe symptoms that are
difficult to see or hear or see without the use of an opthalmoscope or stethoscope. For
example, it is not usually usually used to treat heart problem, lung infections, or abdominal
pain. My website has a list of diagnosis which I don't think are safe to treat with a Telehealth
visit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, there are some symptoms or conditions, which it are not obvious whether or not they
are treatable with telemedicine or not. An example of this might be COVID symptoms that are
moderate, meaning after 2 to 3 days of runny nose, diarrhea, and fever that seem to be getting
worse. Generally, it is advisable to treat covid at this time. However, Mild symptom of covid in a health person who has been vaccinated in the last 6 months usually only requires medications
that make a person feel more comfortable, such as Tylenol. And if a person has severe
symptoms of COVID they need to be seen in an emergency room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are unsure if a telemedicine visit is appropriate for you, you can email me. I usually
respond in 24 hours. However, if you feel your symptoms REQUIRE a quicker response I would
advise you to be seen in either an urgent care or an emergency room. But, which one you
might ask: ER or urgent care. The best advise I can give you is to call the urgent care or
emergency room or primary doctor *if you have one) that you are planning on going to and ask
them if you are an appropriate patient for them. Remember, urgent care and ERs don't want a
bunch of people with the flu or covid coming in to their medical site and spreading these
illnesses—if you don't really need to.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                <div class="number">2</div>
                <h4>Prepare For The Visit</h4>
                <p>
                    Once, you have determined that you are an appropriate patient for telemedicine, ask your self is
there something that I need to do for the visit? Do I need to take my temperature? Do I need to
know my blood pressure? Do I need to know my pulse and my oxygen saturation? Do I need to
take a picture or video of something such as a throat or a rash? <br> <br>
Temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation are called vitals signs. And they are
called this for a reason, if any one of these signs are too far away from normal range it is an
indication that you need to seen for your illness quickly either in an urgent care or ER. <br> <br>
knowing all of these vitals signs is very helpful. <br><br>
If you are seeing me: I expect that you have at least one of these vitals signs that you can show
me, and hopefully all four.
                </p>

            <div class="step">
                <div class="number">3</div>
                <h4>How Urgent is Your Situation?</h4>
                <p>The next step before booking an appointment is that you must ask yourself: how fast do you
                    need to be seen? Because I work by myself, and only work part time, I can only see 10 patients
                    per day, you may not be able to see me today. However, there are more and more telemedicine
                    services being offered every day, some are advertising 7 days a week 24 hours a day. Of
                    coarse, if you choose another Telehealth service, you need to make certain that they will treat
                    your condition and what they will charge you before scheduling an appointment—if this is
                    possible.
                </p>
                <p>Remember, I have a list of symptoms that I do treat—and I don't treat, and when in doubt you
                    can email me dwight.partner@yahoo.com. I don't know how other telemedicine services
                    communicate their costs and what symptoms they treat.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                <div class="number">4</div>
                <h4>Schedule an Appointment</h4>
                <p>If you have done all of the above preliminary steps, you can schedule an appointment with me,
                    or any other telemedicine service. Look at the calendar and click on an available appointment
                    day and time (an unshaded block).</p>
                <p>You will be given a zoom link to log into on the day and time of your appointment. Please try to
                    log in about 15 minutes before your appointment time, you will be put into a waiting room until
                    the provider also logs in.</p>

                <div class="number">5</div>
                <h4>Medical History</h4>
                <p>If you are asking to be treated for mild to moderate symptoms of a common illness, and have
                    some of your vital signs, I will usually be able to make your diagnosis and send a prescription to
                    a pharmacy near you. I believe you will be happy with the treatment you receive from me.
                    But, if for some reason I can not help you, I will not charge you.</p>

                <h4>Pay For Telehealth Visit</h4>
                <p>At the end of the visit you will be requested to pay $38.00 from either a credit card or Venmo,
                    Zelle, Cash App, or PayPal.</p>

                <h4>Pick Up Your Medication</h4>
                <p>Pick up your prescription medication, and take it as ordered. By the way, you will be responsible
                    for paying for your medication. I always try to order the least expensive medication that will
                    work for your condition—but sometime medication s are expensive whether you have insurance
                    or not.</p>
